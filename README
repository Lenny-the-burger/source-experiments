Burger's source expirements.

I will be making mini mods for the source engine, source files for GMOD addons are in other repos,
	this repo is exclusivly for source expirements, will not contain anything related to jhammer.

Plans so far:
	- AutoLOD
		Automatically and programatically create dynamic LOD-like effect. Aims to somewhat recreate
		unreal engine's "Nanite" feature but more aggresive because its the source engine.

	- ModDL
		Faster server loading time, hopefully beat out GMOD's FastDL and without having to
		have a seperate server. Will try to use very aggresive compression and maybe rewrite
		some of the networking code to allow source to take full advantage of modern hardware.

Original README for the 2013 has been removed as it is identical to the LISCENCE file. If you want to
	read it go there.

You are free to use my code any way you want, just give me proper attribution. If you want to use it
	in a commercial project plese contact me first, preferably over discord: Lenny the burger#3575
